### Fundamentals of Blockchain

1. Cryptography
   2. hashing algos 
   3. Merkle Trees
2. Distributed Systems
   3. distributed != decentralized
3. Game Theory
   4. consensus algos
   5. PoW --> complex computations to mine blocks; disincentives to behave dishonestly as more complex the computations become the more energy req'd to mine
   6. PoS --> "proof of participation"
      7. amount of coins that the validator has is used ("staked") to validate and mine blocks
      8. incentives validators to behave honestly ; why? b/c their staked tokens can be revoked?
