# Data Structures - Concepts & Terminology

## _call stack_
- a data structure that stores information about the active subroutines (or function calls) of a computer program. 
- used by most programming languages to keep track of function calls and local variables
- each time a function is called, a new frame (or record) is added to the stack containing information such as the function's parameters, its local variables, and the address to return control to once the function completes
